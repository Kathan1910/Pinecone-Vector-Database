       " Document(page_content='How to Choose a Data Visualization – 3Introduction\\nData visualizations are a vital component of a data analysis, as they have the \\nability to efficiently summarize large amounts of data through a graphical \\nformat. There are many chart types available, each with their own strengths \\nand use cases. One of the trickiest parts of the analysis process is choosing \\nthe right way to represent your data using one of these visualizations.\\nWhen deciding on a chart type, first think about the type of role the chart \\nwill serve. Common roles for data visualization include:\\n• showing change over time\\n• showing a part-to-whole composition\\n• depicting flows and processes\\n• looking at how data is distributed\\n• comparing values between groups\\n• observing relationships between variables\\n• looking at geographical data\\nNext, consider the types of data you want to plot. The type of chart you \\nuse will depend on if the data is categorical, numeric, or some combina-\\ntion of both. Certain visualizations can also be used for multiple purposes \\ndepending on these factors. This book is organized with this approach \\nin mind, with one chapter for each visualization role, each with multiple \\nchart types to cover common types of data and subtasks.\\nNote that this document should only serve as a general guideline: it is pos-\\nsible that breaking out of the standard modes will help you gain additional \\ninsights. Experiment with not just different chart types, but also how the \\nvariables are encoded in each chart. It’s also good to keep in mind that you \\naren’t limited to showing everything in just one plot. It is often better to \\nkeep each individual plot as simple and clear as possible, and instead use \\nmultiple plots to make comparisons, show trends, and demonstrate rela-\\ntionships between multiple variables.', metadata={'source': 'pdfs_docs\\\\dataviz.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='How to Choose a Data Visualization – 4How this book is organized\\nThis book is divided into chapters, one for each of the main categories for \\nusing a data visualization. Each chapter is headed by a short introduction, \\nfollowed by a list of chart types falling in that category. Each chart type is \\naccompanied by a short description and one or more icons. Below is a key \\nfor decoding these symbols:\\nBASIC: Chart types with this icon represent typical or standard chart \\ntypes. When you need to create a data visualization, try to see if one \\nof these chart types works first, before deciding on an uncommon or \\nadvanced type.\\nUNCOMMON: Chart types with this icon are slightly more unusual \\nthan the most common chart types. Use cases for these charts are \\nmore specialized than other chart types in that same category or more \\nfrequently seen in other roles.\\nADVANCED: Chart types with this icon are even more specialized in \\ntheir roles. Make sure that the chart type is the best one for your use \\ncase before implementing it. Sometimes, these chart types will not be \\nbuilt into visualization software or libraries, and additional work will \\nneed to be done to put these types of chart together.\\nConnection icons: Some chart types appear in multiple \\nchapters of the book, having either multiple use cases \\nor use cases that straddle multiple roles. In these cases, \\nyou’ll see a rounded rectangle with its entry noting the \\nother chapters in which that chart type directly appears. \\nChart types seen in boxes represent sub-topics within each visualization \\nrole; these will have more specialized and advanced use cases.', metadata={'source': 'pdfs_docs\\\\dataviz.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='How to Choose a Data Visualization – 3Introduction\\nData visualizations are a vital component of a data analysis, as they have the \\nability to efficiently summarize large amounts of data through a graphical \\nformat. There are many chart types available, each with their own strengths \\nand use cases. One of the trickiest parts of the analysis process is choosing \\nthe right way to represent your data using one of these visualizations.\\nWhen deciding on a chart type, first think about the type of role the chart \\nwill serve. Common roles for data visualization include:\\n• showing change over time\\n• showing a part-to-whole composition\\n• depicting flows and processes\\n• looking at how data is distributed\\n• comparing values between groups\\n• observing relationships between variables\\n• looking at geographical data\\nNext, consider the types of data you want to plot. The type of chart you \\nuse will depend on if the data is categorical, numeric, or some combina-\\ntion of both. Certain visualizations can also be used for multiple purposes \\ndepending on these factors. This book is organized with this approach \\nin mind, with one chapter for each visualization role, each with multiple \\nchart types to cover common types of data and subtasks.\\nNote that this document should only serve as a general guideline: it is pos-\\nsible that breaking out of the standard modes will help you gain additional \\ninsights. Experiment with not just different chart types, but also how the \\nvariables are encoded in each chart. It’s also good to keep in mind that you \\naren’t limited to showing everything in just one plot. It is often better to \\nkeep each individual plot as simple and clear as possible, and instead use \\nmultiple plots to make comparisons, show trends, and demonstrate rela-\\ntionships between multiple variables.', metadata={'source': 'pdfs_docs\\\\dataviz.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='How to Choose a Data Visualization – 4How this book is organized\\nThis book is divided into chapters, one for each of the main categories for \\nusing a data visualization. Each chapter is headed by a short introduction, \\nfollowed by a list of chart types falling in that category. Each chart type is \\naccompanied by a short description and one or more icons. Below is a key \\nfor decoding these symbols:\\nBASIC: Chart types with this icon represent typical or standard chart \\ntypes. When you need to create a data visualization, try to see if one \\nof these chart types works first, before deciding on an uncommon or \\nadvanced type.\\nUNCOMMON: Chart types with this icon are slightly more unusual \\nthan the most common chart types. Use cases for these charts are \\nmore specialized than other chart types in that same category or more \\nfrequently seen in other roles.\\nADVANCED: Chart types with this icon are even more specialized in \\ntheir roles. Make sure that the chart type is the best one for your use \\ncase before implementing it. Sometimes, these chart types will not be \\nbuilt into visualization software or libraries, and additional work will \\nneed to be done to put these types of chart together.\\nConnection icons: Some chart types appear in multiple \\nchapters of the book, having either multiple use cases \\nor use cases that straddle multiple roles. In these cases, \\nyou’ll see a rounded rectangle with its entry noting the \\nother chapters in which that chart type directly appears. \\nChart types seen in boxes represent sub-topics within each visualization \\nrole; these will have more specialized and advanced use cases.', metadata={'source': 'pdfs_docs\\\\dataviz.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Feel free to print the graphic out and use it as a quick refer-\\nence for any time you need to visualize your data. \\nWhen using the chart picker, don’t forget to keep in mind three points:\\n1. What kind of role or analysis will the chart perform?\\n2. What types of data do I have – categorical or numeric – and how many \\nvariables am I going to plot?\\n3. After creating the chart, does it convey useful information? If not, try \\na different chart type or a different way of encoding variables.

       " Document(page_content='How to Choose a Data Visualization – 25Appendix B: Charts that should be used  \\njudiciously\\nThere are a few chart types excluded from the guide that probably \\nwouldn’t be considered too rare or specialized. Chart types like the ones \\nin this section have been excluded since they are less efficient than other, \\nmore common chart types, or have flaws that make them more difficult \\nto understand. Only use these charts when you have a unique or specific \\npoint that would benefit from an alternative representation.\\nPictogram / Isotype\\nUsed to compare values between groups and other places \\na bar chart might be used. Each icon represents a specific \\nquantity; values are usually rounded to the nearest whole \\nnumber of icons. Thus, this loses some precision compared \\nto the more common bar chart.\\nCircular / radial bar chart\\nA bar chart, but with bars plotted in concentric arcs. \\nHowever, this distorts each group’s value, since it is not \\nclear whether values are indicated by bar angles or arc \\nlengths. It is better to just stick with a standard bar chart.\\nRadar / spider plot\\nUsed to compare values between data points on multiple \\nattributes. Each attribute is a spoke, with value indicated \\nby distance from the center. One polygon is traced for each \\ndata point. However, people often perceive value based on \\npolygon area, which depends on the order of attributes.

The horizontal orientation can be useful when the \\ngroups have long names.\\nSmall multiples / faceting\\nRather than plotting multiple groups or categories on a \\nsingle axis, just create one plot for each group. This can \\nmake it easier to distinguish between groups, especially \\nwhen there are many of them (e.g. line chart vs. sparkline). \\nYou may want to order the facets by some data feature, like \\noverall size.\\nChart compositions / dashboards\\nCollections of charts, statistics, and tables are used to \\nquickly convey key information to users at an organiza-\\ntion.
